## Before you start, file an issue

Please follow this simple rule to help us eliminate any unnecessary wasted effort & frustration, and ensure an efficient and effective use of everyone's time - yours, ours, and other community members':

> ðŸ‘‰ If you have a question, think you've discovered an issue, would like to propose a new feature, etc., then find/file an issue **BEFORE** starting work to fix/implement it.

### Search existing issues first

Before filing a new issue, search existing open and closed issues first: This project is moving fast! It is likely someone else has found the problem you're seeing, and someone may be working on or have already contributed a fix!

If no existing item describes your issue/feature, great - please file a new issue:

### File a new Issue

- Don't know whether you're reporting an issue or requesting a feature? File an issue
- Have a question that you don't see answered in docs, videos, etc.? File an issue
- Want to know if we're planning on building a particular feature? File an issue
- Got a great idea for a new feature? File an issue/request/idea
- Don't understand how to do something? File an issue
- Found an existing issue that describes yours? Great - upvote and add additional commentary / info / repro-steps / etc.
 
Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and address the problem.
