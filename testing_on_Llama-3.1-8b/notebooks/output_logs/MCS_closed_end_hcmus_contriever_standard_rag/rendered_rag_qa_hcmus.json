Your response start after \"Thought: \", where you will methodically break down the reasoning process, illustrating how you arrive at conclusions. Conclude with \"Answer: \" to present a concise, definitive response, devoid of additional elaborations, and keep the same writing style as the found source text if the question is a open-ended question else you can answer just Yes or No."
